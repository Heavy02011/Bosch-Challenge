# Bosch-Path-Planning-Challenge
Race down a highway with a path planner that best decides how to pass other traffic and manuever the car.

# Test Track Release
The first test track of a highway that continuously goes down the same direction but with some slight curviness. The target is to drive down 2.75 miles of the track as fast as possible without going over the speed limit, crashing into other cars, violating acceleration more than 10 m/s^2 and jerk more than 10 m/s^3, and not driving between the dashed lines for more than 3 seconds or going off the ride side of the road.

# This challenge is based off of the Self-Driving Car Term 3 Project 1: Path Planing.
The competive challenge element added to this project is a brand new highway to test on, along with a timer element that measures how quickly the target 2.75 miles can be completed without incident. If the car takes longer than 360 seconds to complete 2.75 miles then it will be an incomplete. It will also be an incomplete for any violation listed above.
